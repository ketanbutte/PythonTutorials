    "A: It is collection of information in a specific order.\n",

    "#### When should I use Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection of Data**: When you want store collection of data e.g age of students, name of team players, temperature of cities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data in Required Order**: You want to store the data in a specific order, e.g country list in a specific order, countries with most population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    (*Note*- By specific order, it does not mean list elements should be in descending or ascending or alphabetical order \n",
    "    rather you expect the list elements at a specific place.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Mutable**: You should be able to make changes in collection of Data. e.g I completely forgot to add USA in list of countries. No problem, lists allow you to do that. **<u>Tuple</u>** is one such data type which does not allow changes in collection of data"
